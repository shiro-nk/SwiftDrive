Swift Drive: A Simple Project Management System

ICS4U Term Project
A simple java group task managment system composed of a server and client.
A team leader would be able to run a local server, create a list of users,
create a list of tasks, and keep track of progress. Clients could in turn
connect to the server, log in, and change their progress.

Disclaimers:
This code was written for, and only for, the ICS4U term project and is
not intended for distribution. The network code in this project is
**insecure** as I was learning how to use sockets at the time and the
code was only intended for a demo in a secure environment. If you choose
to do so, please use this code at your own risk.

While all the code in the final version(s) is written by me, there exists 
many older versions in the commit history which contain parts of a GUI 
interface, complete with art, produced with Mohan Pan. Since none of 
said code is included in the final version, the copyright below has been
modified to reflect that.
